About

Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa known
for its dramatic landscape and diverse wildlife, much of it
within parks, reserves and safari areas. On the Zambezi
River, Victoria Falls make a thundering 108m drop into
narrow Batoka Gorge, where there's white-water rafting and
bungee-jumping. Downstream are Matusadona and Mana
Pools national parks, home to hippos, rhinos and birdlife.
